# QuikDot

QuikDot Sans is a modified [Quikscript
Sans](https://bitbucket.org/pcdandy/quikscript-sans) (see
[`README-upstream.md`](README-upstream.md)) which replaces the Latin
alphabetic characters a-z, A-Z, ø, æ, Æ, Ø, and ß, and ẞ with
[Dotsies](https://dotsies.org). In particular, with the 5 dot
positions interpreted as binary digits, characters "0" thru "31" are `
ediclhvbnkugtsøaomyjxræfwqzpÆØß`, matching `Dotsies.ttf`'s
values. Capital letters A-Z and ẞ have tiny capitalization indication
dots above their minuscule forms.
